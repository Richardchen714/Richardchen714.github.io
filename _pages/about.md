I'm an MS student in Networked Systems at University of California, Irvine (UCI) starting in 2023. Before that, I received my BEng degree (2023) in Computer Science & Technology at Southeast University (SEU), China. I had been an visiting undergrad at UCI from Sep 2022 to Jun 2023.

I'm trying to extend my research interests to machine learning in security and data privacy.

My previous research areas include Machine Learning, 3D Computer Vision, Self-Supervised Learning (generative and contrastive models), and Reinforcement Learning.
