======

I'm an MS student in Networked Systems at University of California, Irvine (UCI) starting in 2023. Before that, I received my BEng degree (2023) in Computer Science & Technology at Southeast University (SEU), China. I had been an exchange undergrad at UCI from Sep 2022 to Jun 2023.

My research interests include Machine Learning, 3D Computer Vision, Self-Supervised Learning (generative and contrastive models), and Reinforcement Learning.

Here's a copy of my CV.
