## Interesting Facts about Me
- I love swimming and hiking.
- I had learned to play the piano for about 10 yrs, unfortunately due to lack of practice since high school, I can hardly play now. However I'm still a classical music fan today and attend classical concerts sometimes, some of my favorite composers are L. v. Beethoven, J. Brahms, F. F. Chopin. I'm a fan of YouTuber [TwoSet Violin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAzKFALPuF_EPe-AEI0WFFw). (I wish I could be a "lingling" in computer science and music)
- Apart from classical music, I also enjoy pop, rock, (and some) country, etc. According to my Replay 2023 by Apple Music, some of the artists I like the most are Green Day, Billy Joel, and Elton John.
